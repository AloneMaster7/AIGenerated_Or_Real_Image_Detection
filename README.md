# AI vs. Human Face Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains two deep learning models with identical architectures but different training strategies for distinguishing AI-generated faces from real human photographs. The models achieve state-of-the-art performance in detecting synthetic facial imagery with exceptional accuracy and generalization capabilities.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Dual Model Approach**: Two PyTorch models with same architecture, different training strategies
- **High Accuracy**: 99.2% test accuracy without overfitting
- **Real-world Validation**: Successfully tested on real smartphone camera images and AI-generated faces
- **Perfect Detection**: 100% accuracy on validation set with real-world samples
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Mixed sources of real and synthetic facial images

## 📊 Performance Metrics
| Metric | Model 1 | Model 2 | Combined Evaluation |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Test Accuracy | 99.2% | 99.1% | - |
| Real Images Detection | - | - | 100% |
| AI-generated Detection | - | - | 100% |
| Validation Accuracy | 99.0% | 98.8% | - |

## 🏗️ Architecture
Both models share the same neural network architecture:
- **Backbone**: Custom CNN architecture (details in model.py)
- **Input Size**: 224×224 RGB images
- **Output**: Binary classification (Real vs AI-generated)
- **Loss Function**: Cross-entropy with regularization
- **Optimizer**: Adam with cosine annealing scheduler

## 🚀 Training Strategies
### **Model 1**: Standard Training
- Standard data augmentation
- Balanced class weighting
- Early stopping implementation

### **Model 2**: Enhanced Training
- Advanced augmentation pipeline
- Curriculum learning approach
- Focal loss implementation
- Mixed precision training
